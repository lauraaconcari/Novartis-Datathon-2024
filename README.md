## Introduction

This project focuses on leveraging data science and machine learning methodologies to analyze and extract insights from healthcare data provided during the Novartis Hackathon. The goal is to propose innovative solutions to real-world problems in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transformation of raw datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and insights from the data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of predictive models to address the challenge.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Model performance evaluation and comparison.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following tools and libraries:

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Jupyter Notebook

## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/novartis-hackathon.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd novartis-hackathon
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Novartis_hack.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

1. Load the dataset(s) used in the project (ensure they are placed in the correct directory).
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to:
   - Preprocess the data.
   - Visualize the key patterns and trends.
   - Train and evaluate machine learning models.
3. Modify parameters or code as needed for further exploration.
